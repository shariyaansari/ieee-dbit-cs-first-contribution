## üéØ Your Mission

Your goal is to add your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file in this project by creating a Pull Request.

### The Workflow: Step-by-Step

1.  **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.

2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ieee-dbit-cs-first-contribution.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ieee-dbit-cs-first-contribution.git)
    cd ieee-dbit-cs-first-contribution
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.)*

3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes. A good branch name is descriptive.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b add-your-name
    ```

4.  **Edit the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file:** Open the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file and add your name and GitHub profile link to the bottom of the list.
    * Format: `- [Your Full Name](https://github.com/your-username)`

5.  **Stage and Commit** your changes with a clear message.
    ```bash
    git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
    git commit -m "feat: Add [Your Name] to contributors list"
    ```

6.  **Push** your new branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin add-your-name
    ```

7.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to your forked repository on GitHub. A "Compare & pull request" button will appear. Click it, add a title, and submit your pull request!

Once your Pull Request is reviewed and merged by a workshop mentor, you will officially be an open source contributor!
